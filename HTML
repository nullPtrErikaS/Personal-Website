<pre>Hi!

My tech journey began with my love for sandbox games, where I discovered the joy of letting my creativity run free. 
I also enjoy puzzle games and can solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, graduating in May 2026.
My primary interest is Software Development, though I am enthusiastic about all areas within the CS field.

At UIC, I was actively involved in the tech community, holding four board positions and participating in one research role.

I'm excited to find a 2025 internship in software development and research where I can meet new people, apply my skills, and continue to grow.</pre>
